# Victim application for the differental attack

The folder `aes-min` contains a minimal AES128 software implementation by Craig McQueen ([cmcqueen/aes-min on GitHub, version 0.3.1](https://github.com/cmcqueen/aes-min/tree/728e156091b95a7f2e8882b7dee012e9a6ea6213) that we use as target for our attack. We removed some files (like tests) that are not necessary for compiling the victim program. Please refer to the original repository if you are interested in the `aes-min` project.
